<h1>What Does Inspiration Look Like?</h1>
<br>
<cite>-Much Love 3:57pm 20/03/2020 -</cite>By me.
<br>
<br>
<p>I love watching something I don't understand. Alan Holdsworth, Virgil Donati, Dillinger Escape Plan, Meshuggah, Thomas Lang, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea. I love these musos and bands. Even being a prfessional musician, I would have no idea where to start to learn the songs that  these muso's create. It's as if they were transcending some alien-like telepathy when they were in the practice room and everyone in those bands somehow could intercept the signal. <br>
I also think these types of bands are a great source of inspiration for the muso community who have been in the game for a while.<br> 
Do me a favour and try to imagine Alan Holdsworth playing "Sweet Child Of Mine" at a covers gig down the road at your local pub. I don't know about you, but I can't see it. Frankly, I don't think he could get paid enough for that kind of gig.<br>
Conversely, Slash, (who wrote that riff) an absolute beast of a guitarist as everyone knows - would be happy to play it again for a small fortune I'm sure. He among many others has been paid handsomely for playing that riff. <br>
It's crazy to think that in 2020 young students pay people just to learn how to play "Sweet Child Of Mine." A riff that was written as a joke string skipping exercise by Slash in the late 80's. Yep, that's over 30 years ago! I agree, it's a strange world that we live in. 
<br>
<br>
So where does this leave us?? Well, the last thing I want to do is learn how to play a song that adds to the problem so many of us get caught up in. Us muso's learn 40 iconic songs and we play the same songs every weekend for the rest of our lives and then we get bored of playing music for $$ so we stop playing music all together... Noooooo!!
<br>
<br>
I'm trying my best to not make that mistake again. More importantly, I don't want you to make this mistake at all. 
<br>
<br>
Let me tell you something you already know, but still may be helpful.<br> 
As musicians, we need to be constantly learning. Please don't ever forget this!! this is key to growing as a musician and as a human being. But I hear you saying, "Seriously! why else do we need to do this?? I don't have time!" <br>Because we love it remember!? New songs, new styles, new techniques, new instruments, new bands. This one aspect is our saving grace from becoming what we all don't need in our lives.. Feeling jaded or resentment. It's a useless and disabling feeling that gets you nowhere. <br>
Learning new skills is such an empowering thing to do for yourself. I'd imagine that all the artists like Alan Holdsworth or Thomas Lang don't get to that jaded state because they are the types of people that push themselves to the next level and the next level after that!... For instance, did you know Thomas Lang has produced over 600 Albums??.. I just found this out the other day! I knew him as the insanely talented drummer that looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's another example of someone who is always learning. A new song, technique, genre, instrument or a new facet of the musical world; music business, audio engineering, copyright law, sound design, sales and marketing. Don't make the same mistakes I did. Say it with me "Always learn something new."
