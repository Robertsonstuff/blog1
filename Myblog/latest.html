<h1>Treat Yourself??</h1>
<br>
<cite>-Much love 9:45am 12/12/2020-</cite>By me.
<br>
<br>
<p>
Treating yourself to a beer or cake is a universal concept. We all get to a point where we want to treat ourselves to a beer, cake or fried food because we want to treat ourselves for achieving something, or just getting through the day.
<br>
<br>
What interests me is these things go against the goals that most of us have in our lives. We all want to be more in shape, feel better, lose a few kg's and everyone wants to look good naked... So why is a beer treating ourselves? The question seems dumb, doesn't it? but humour me, it also illuminates the human logic in us all. Doesn't it make more sense to treat ourselves with a run, a gym session, a salad or getting 10000 steps a day?
<br>
<br>
I guess this idea is spurred on by a podcast I listened to recently about paying attention to the way things taste. It painted the picture of people who pay real attention to the foods they eat and drink. Those people cut out cigarettes, soft drinks, lollies with almost no withdrawal.
<br>
<br>
This is helping me think more clearly about what I fill my day with. I think going to the gym helps me be OK with some discomfort - knowing full well that it's only for a specific time frame. When other things happen within my day outside of the gym. I'm tolerant of more discomfort. I guess this only gets easier with getting older too... Or do you? I guess you gain more perspective as you get older, but do you get used to being uncomfortable? I notice that most people get used to doing the same thing whether it's good for them or not. 
I think a better way to think is to treat yourself with discomfort regularly because you surely don't want to do what most people do by doing what's comfortable.
<br>
<br>
I'm inspired to live with more healthy choices. I've been off work sick for a week and after watching an action film. I've realised that I've always been inspired by secret agents, special forces and guys of that nature. I get excited about being a man of mystery. I'm now understanding that I get one fucking life, it's up to me to crush the shit out of life!!
<br>
<br>
So I'm gonna treat myself with a salad everyday! 7mins of sweat everyday, hone some skills I want to acquire everyday, kiss my girlfriend everyday.
