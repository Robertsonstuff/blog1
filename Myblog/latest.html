<h1>OK! I admit it! I was wrong... </h1>
<br>
<cite>-Much love 9:30pm 09/08/2020-</cite>By me.
<br>
<br>
<p>
For me, I remember when I decided to do music full time. I went to uni, I joined all the bands I could. At one stage I was playing with 7 different bands at one time and playing live around 3 times per week. What a time right!? It was fun, that's for sure. But being 24 and earning $300 per week is not so fun. <br>
The problem is, as a muso you can play the gigs and enjoy the lifestyle of being a freelancer. But if you want to earn the money that I would like to earn and play music full time, you have to run your own business. 
 remember trying to find a Cafe gig that was more regular at least I could earn enough money to get out of the house... Just for clarification, I was a full-time muso, and I was looking for a Cafe gig and couldn't... Oh, dear. 
 <br>
 <br>
I had this niche skill of performing in live acts both in cover bands and original bands. At this stage, I was teaching kids how to play guitar and drums and even still I was lucky to clear $300 a week. No wonder I was still living at mums' place. <br>
Anyway, I found it really difficult. I didn't have experience and all the Cafe gigs I could get paid $10 per hour. <br>
I remember feeling that no matter what I did, I felt trapped. I spent all my free time playing drums or guitar or hanging with mates to get a fresh perspective. I just seemed to run into the same brick walls. <br>
 So how did I change? How did I get untrapped? How did I free myself? .... I got a "real job". <br>
 If it was perspective I needed... For better or worse... It was the perspective I got! 
 I met all these different people that I wouldn't usually come in to contact with. My world was muso types or real job types. When I started my trade, I met people who were grateful just to have a job.. Me being one of them. I also met people who wanted to learn as much as they could. I think this was the first time I saw all walks of lives in one place. Perspective. I found it! 
 <br>
 <br>
All these years I've spent thinking about how to make more money as a muso. I was really looking for a way to have gigs flowing in 3 times a week whilst tutoring. But here's thing! I didn't call one venue, I didn't call other working bands or network in any way. I wasn't prepared to advertise my efforts at all. Nope, no business card. Not even a fucking free Facebook page!!... <br>
I only had huge expectations without any execution or plan for that matter. What can I say? I had no idea how to run a business. I was a muso that thought he knew what he was doing... How wrong I was.
