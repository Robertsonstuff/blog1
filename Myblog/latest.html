<h1>Beyonce and Rolls Royce</h1>
<br>
<cite>-Much love 9:45am 20/02/2021-</cite>By me.
<br>
<br>
<p>
It's crazy that we spend thousands of hours sucking at learning an instrument only for someone to like our post on Instagram. I know that is never why people learn an instrument but if this has ever crossed your mind, you're gonna need an attitude check!
<br>
<br>
I've had years of underestimating my skills when I was younger. If you're a musician and you've been playing gigs and teaching a bit, this is for you. I've been in this headspace for years where I wasn't earning the kind of money I deserved. I then slowly ended up in this space where I thought that maybe you just can't earn money performing music. "Maybe this job is just not needed". it's a luxury thing... Yep and so is first class when you fly a plane, or Bentley's and Rolls Royce... Do they still exist?! <br>
<br>
So if music is a luxury lifestyle subject, why aren't we getting paid the big bucks like Rolls Royce? Why is it that a stereotypical musician is still someone who is asked, but what do you do for money??
<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at someone who gets paid the big bucks as a musician... Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. Are they good musicians? Yes! Are they living the good life? Well, according to Beyonce is estimated to be worth $400 million, Bruce - $500 million, Tay Tay - $365 million, FYI Paul McCartney from that band the Beatles; who were only around for 9 years, is worth $1.2 billion. Now we're talking!!<br>
<br>
Do they just practice and play gigs in their spare time?? No!! So why do you think that's all you need to do...
<br>
<br>
I know I've said this lots in this blog but muso's these days need to it all. Marketing, sales, performing, recording, publishing, copyright, IP, distribution, logistics.. the fun never stops. I'm sure that Beyonce doesn't, but any muso who doesn't have their entourage of teams behind them will at least need to be aware of and operate in all of these fields. I remember Steve Smith (drummer of Journey) saying in an interview that - even he - has to worry about all of these things when he's doing jazz gigs with Vital Information, and he's been in the game for a long time.

More on this next week.
