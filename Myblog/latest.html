<h1>Beyonce and Rolls Royce</h1>
<br>
<cite>-Much love 9:45am 20/02/2021-</cite>By me [updated - 08/03/2021].
<br>
<br>
<p>
It's crazy that we spend thousands of hours sucking at learning an instrument only for someone to like our post on Instagram. I know that is never why people learn an instrument but if this has ever crossed your mind, you're gonna need an attitude check!
<br>
<br>
I've had years of underestimating my skills when I was younger. If you're a musician and you've been playing gigs and teaching a bit, this is for you. I've been in this headspace for years where I wasn't earning the kind of money I deserved. I then slowly ended up in this space where I thought that maybe you just can't earn money performing music. "Maybe this job is just not needed". it's a luxury thing... Yep and so is first class when you fly a plane, or Bentley's and Rolls Royce... Do they still exist?! <br>
<br>
So if music is a luxury lifestyle subject, why aren't we getting paid the big bucks like Rolls Royce? Why is it that a stereotypical musician is still someone who is asked, but what do you do for money??
<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at someone who gets paid the big bucks as a musician... Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. Are they good musicians? Yes! Are they living the good life? Well, according to Beyonce is estimated to be worth $400 million, Bruce - $500 million, Tay Tay - $365 million, FYI Paul McCartney from that band the Beatles; who were only around for 9 years, is worth $1.2 billion. Now we're talking!!<br>
<br>
Do they just practice and play gigs in their spare time?? No!! So why do you think that's all you need to do...
<br>
<br>
I know I've said this lots in this blog but muso's these days need to it all. Marketing, sales, performing, recording, publishing, copyright, IP, distribution, logistics.. the fun never stops. I'm sure that Beyonce doesn't, but any muso who doesn't have their entourage of teams behind them will at least need to be aware of and operate in all of these fields. I remember Steve Smith (drummer of Journey) saying in an interview that - even he - has to worry about all of these things when he's doing jazz gigs with Vital Information, and he's been in the game for a long time.
<br>
<br>
So let's imagine a young musician who's talented, plays a few gigs each month, teaches a little bit but earns just enough money to get by. I'm sure a lot of musicians get to this stage, maybe you can earn a little bit more or less some months but in the end, your earning money playing and teaching music. That's awesome!!<br>
With that said, I'm looking at the next stage. I'm interested at 100k + wages playing music. How do we get there?? Yes, it's very possible. Let's do some math.<br>
At bare minimum:
<br>
<br>
With 1 gig a week ($500) = 26k a year = 5 hours per week.
20 students ($50/hour each) =<br>
40k a year = 40 hours per week for 40 weeks (school holidays).
Gets you to $66k a year.
But we can do more than 1 gig a week right!?
Let's do two gigs a week!!
$92k a year is sounding pretty healthy now.
<br>
<br>
Ok so, if you're operating like this and you managed to organise yourself to do this consistently - which is not easy, yet possible. It's a big year!! It means that you'll working 50hr weeks for 40 weeks of the year!  You'd be working your butt off for that 92k! Remember this pre tax so it would really be more like 80k. <br>
So, 50hr weeks for 80k a year. Is roughly $30/hour of work - that's what you're worth!!
I'm not sure about you, but I think a specialist skill is worth north than this don't you?
<br>
<br>
Let's try another scenario.<br>
With 1 gig a week ($500) = 26k a year = 5 hours per week.
An unskilled 9-5pm job = 60k a year = 37.5hours per week.
= 86k per year at 42 hours per week work.
But we can do more than 1 gig a week right!?
Let's do two gigs a week!!
$112k a year is sounding pretty healthy now.
<br>
<br>
We've broke the 100k!! Woohoo!
And!! We are working still less hours than the first scenario.
Remember this is pre tax so it's probably like 97k for 47 hours per week - so you're still working hard for it $39 per hour for working less... Not bad, but it's not enough is it!?
<br>
<br>
What does it look like to earn that Bentley money!? 
<br>
<br>
What does Beyonce do?? I'm so glad you asked.
Beyonce is 39 years young and has 6 studio albums to her name. In 2016 Beyonc√© saw her most successful tour to date, The Formation Tour grossing more than U$260.000.000 in just 49 shows. That's $5.3 million a show!!
<br>
<br>
With 1 gig a week ($5.3 million) = 260 million a year = countless hours per week.
How's that for a scenario!!
I'm not sure what her profit margin was but hey, I'm sure she doesn't need to work again. Haha!
