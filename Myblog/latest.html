<h1>Where's the poop!?</h1>
<br>
<cite>-Much love 3:38pm 20/06/2020-</cite>By me.
<br>
<br>
<p>Ok, I'll say it. I love podcasts!! 
<br>
I feel like I'm an old fuddy-duddy by saying this. It's like I just said, "I love AM radio!!".
<br>
<br>
So lately I've tried to listen to some awesome drummers that I look up to; Thomas Lang, Marco Minemann, Vinnie Colaiuta, Chris Coleman, Anika Nilles etc. I notice there are certain questions that aren't being asked - no disrespect to our beloved podcast hosts, I understand that they don't want to spend time dragging their heroes/guests through all the hardest things they had to deal with in life - But for some sick and twisted reason, I wanna know! 
I would love to know more about the struggles of my drumming heroes, the time they decided to be a drummer to the time they were earning good money to validate their initial decision. Or the time they played gigs and didn't get paid when they really needed a dollar. I want to hear their low points that tested their nerve and the self-talk that got them out of it. 
<br>
<br>
It's helpful to hear someone you look up to find stages in their life difficult, even if we already know that no one goes through life without struggle. The problem is it's so easy to see our heroes success and accomplishments. Most of the time you have to go looking for the dirt in their life story. What can I say, I'm attracted to the dirt. Who knew!? 
<br>
<br>
I'm curious why we need to look so hard to find personal struggles. I think these are the stories that can really help others. I can understand if these heroes of ours have a problem sharing intimate details to the world. After all, drummers are used to supporting others rather than the spotlight.
<br>
<br>
I don't know.. 
<br>
<br>
I still want to hear the dirt in their life stories though. Am I dark and twisted? Am I alone in thinking this? Or am I on to something here?
