Question:<br>
Do I have to always practice with a metronome?<br>
Answer:<br>
Do you listen to anything other than yourself when you play? If you want to have good rhythm that gets people in the audience tapping their feet, practice with a metronome. If you perform with other musicians, you'll need the ability to actively listen - on the fly - while your playing, practice with a metronome. If you play gigs by yourself with a loose sense of time, in a flowing manner, and you never plan on playing with other people, sure! No need for a metronome then!
<br>
<br>
Question:<br>
Should I get an ABN / setup to be a sole trader??<br>
Answer:<br>
Yes, if you want to earn money from music, you are a business and you need an ABN.
<br>
<br>
Question:<br>
When should I get a website?<br>
Answer:<br>
Now!! If you don't have one, you will be perceived as unprofessional. A Facebook page and an Instagram account is not enough.
<br>
<br>
Question:<br>
How do I get more gigs?<br>
Answer:<br>
You're going to need as many contacts as possible that have the capacity to book gigs at venues. Booking agents, business owners, event managers etc.
Your contacts need to:<br>
1 know you exist<br>
2 have proof that you are gig ready - posters for promo, website and showreel of your best work in a live setting.<br>
3 be in constantly updated with your availability so they know when you are free before they have to call you and ask.<br>
4 know you are good at what you do and it helps if they like you as a person not just as a performer.<br>
Also<br>
Bonus point**<br>
How's your social media looking?? Do you know how to market yourself? I know you're a musician, but remember, you're a business too!! 
<br>
<br>
Question:<br>
I just have to be a good muso and the gigs will come right??<br>
Answer:<br>
Nope!! You are a business, you need to be working on ALL aspects of your business.<br>
*Marketing - website and social media<br>
*Accounting - know how your business is trending, crunch numbers and be aware of upcoming costs to shape what your next move is. E.g. do I need more gigs?? Do I need to record an album to work on my marketing brand to charge more for gigs later gigs ?? <br>
*Quality content - practice often<br>
*Sales - get gigs<br>
*Legal - am I protected if I use someone else's sample on my recording? Am I protected if someone trips over my amp and hurts themselves?
<br>
<br>
Question:<br>
Should I teach or just do gigs??<br>
Answer:<br>
It's nice to do both. If teaching is getting in the way of doing gigs, drop teaching!! Get something that fits in to your life.
I'm a big advocate of having another job supplimenting your music career with actual $$. It creates a creative space without pressure.
<br>
<br>
Question:<br>
Should I practice 30 mins a day or a big jam session for 4 hours on Sunday?<br>
Answer:<br>
Practice every day. Make sure is quality practice of working on something that actually challenges you. Do this by yourself!! A jam session with your mates is a collective practice which you need, but solitary practice is what you need more.
