I'm super proud of myself. I feel like I've learned so much over this past year. In the past I used to think that if I just practice my instrument, everything else will fall in to place and I'll have a great career. Oh man! How wrong was I! <br>
This year I tried to equip myself with as many tools as I could that I think a musician needs to run their business effectively. Specifically building and maintaining a website, memorising over 15 of my favourite songs, recording, mixing, mastering, copyright and publishing and the most important part of the whole process was believe it or not.. Blogging. Yep, the act writing down some of my experiences and looking at what I've achieved over the years has been invaluable. I believe that it has changed my outlook in my time as a full-time muso from jaded to empowered. 
       <br>
       <br>
My first step was marketing. I needed a website. I decided to learn HTML and css: some basic steps towards creating a functional website, deploying it to a server, updating blog posts and checking my SEO statistics. It's nice to have full control of how my website looks and the best part, it costs me peanuts! 
       <br>
       <br>
Then came writing - I'm terrible at it but hey, practice makes perfect right!? I figured if I made sure there was something new up every month, I've done my job. More often than not, I over delivered for the sheer thrill of seeing something published on the Web for the world to see. 
       <br>
       <br>
After writing came an emence feeling of excitement in uploading my music and showing my friends my recordings. I 'bit the bullet' and spent a few hundred bucks on some recording gear and learned simple principles to record, mix, master and distribute my music. I still have no idea how to make a radio ready song yet. But I do know how to record, mix and master a song in 8 hours and have it up on all the listening platforms like Spotify, iTunes, Google play, soundcloud within a few days. That's super exciting to me! 
       <br>
       <br>
It feels great to learn new skills and I'm really looking forward to honing them in the coming year. I think that for any musician it's seemingly necessary to learn all of these skills. The problem being, if you don't have the time - or make the time - it will cost you a tonne of money everytime you want to be creative or take control in some way. 
We all know time is precious. You'll still need hours in the practice room and time and effort running the business effectively. So my thoughts are with you muso's who are trying to do it all. Unfortunately, it seems like these days, we have to do it all. 
Hereâ€™s to another awesome year of learning lots and putting more music out in to the world. <br>
Much love. </p>
