<h1>What a year will do</h1>
<br>
<cite>-Much love 18/02/2023-</cite>By me.
<br>
<br>
<p>It seems that spending time in New York, getting comfortable in my surroundings, opportunities are starting to arise from living life, meeting new people and saying 'yes' more often.

<!--start bloggingThis time last year, I was stuck in the UK whilst my girlfriend was working in Manhattan. Fast forward to now, my WIFE and I are loving life in Manhattan together, working in our chosen professions, earning good money, living large, visiting bars and restaurants, catching up with friends and finally getting some time to look at some of personal projects again.                                              So its time to look at my musical projects. Life has a way of getting in the way personal goals and projects. I think musicians seem to know this all too well. We are often confronted with knowing what we want to do - play mUsic for a living - only to realise that the world isn't designed to make that easy for us. It's important for us to stay focused, learn to pick up the beloved thing that we put on the shelf and start playing again. we know it makes us happy, and I don't know about you, but I want to live a full and happy life.
How about you? Are you doing what you need to do to make yourself happy?

This time last year, I was stuck in the UK whilst my girlfriend was living in Manhattan. Fast forward to now, my WIFE and I are loving life in Manhattan together, working in our chosen professions, earning good money, living large, visiting bars and restaurants, catching up with friends and finally getting some time to look at some of personal projects again.
<br>
<br>
Speaking of projects, it's time I looked at my musical projects again. Life always has a way of 'getting in the way' of personal goals and projects. I think musicians seem to know this feeling all too well. We are often confronted with knowing what we want to be doing - play music for a living - only to realise that the world isn't designed to make it easy for us. With that in mind, it's important for us muso's to stay focused. It's important to learn to pick up that beloved thing from the shelf and start playing it again. We know it makes us happy, and I don't know about you, but I want to live a full and happy life.
<br>
<br>
How about you? Are you doing what you need to do to make yourself happy?
