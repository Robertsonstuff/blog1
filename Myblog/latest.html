<h1>Making the best tasting lemonade.</h1>
<br>
<cite>-Much love 1:45pm 14/11/2020-</cite>By me.
<br>
<br>
<p>
So you love playing music, hate the industry and try to channel your frustration to work for you to play more music. 
<br>
<br>
This is a quick thought that I think is worth pondering. I think being specific enough about a problem is a good start to make a problem easier to solve. <br>
I love being able to play music. I love to be in a position to entertain others while honing a craft. This is what I want to do for a living! There are so many people who never get the chance to be on a stage in front of hundreds; if not, thousands of people, cheering them on. Music is huuuge! It's what movies, award nights, TV shows and dreams are made of. <br>
I hate that the industry makes it impossible for musicians to EARN a real living without being forced in to a corner of shit gigs for shit money or great money anywhere but home, particularly in Australia. <br>
I believe that there is a solution to design a great life with music being a big part of it, without costing you years of frustration and not earning a real wage. I think this a problem I'll look at for a long time. 
<br>
<br>
You may know that I found a great sense of relief by getting a full-time job aside from music and letting music be my outlet of creativity. I know that 21 year old me would be slapping my face silly - I was a purist back then. While this approach has worked out me, I want more music in my life! I'm going to take another bite at the apple and pursue music in my day-to-day.
<br>
<br>
Part of this blog is to make new approaches and discoveries. I want the stability and safety of a full time job with a good superannuation plan. With the opportunities that music can bring in to the mix. 
For example:
<br>
<br>
*Recording music to be on ads and TV shows<br>
*All expenses paid holiday to tour another country.<br>
*Entertain friends at parties<br>
*Earn some play money while others are pissing it up the wall in the same venue<br>
*Blow up social media platforms for free gear, money and more opportunities for collaborations, chances to meet your favourite musicians.<br>
*Build a following to one day perform my own solo show charging $100 a ticket and earning tens of thousands of dollars in one night!!
<br>
<br>
These are a few things that come to mind that if you're in to your music; you would be crazy to not try and make some of these ideas to become a reality.
<br>
<br>
I used to think that playing live was the best avenue for a long and stable career in music. But I think differently now. My idea of a good life is to have these experiences sprinkled throughout my music career whilst developing my full-time career as well.
<br>
<br>
I'd love to hear your ideas of what opportunities you want to experience in your career.
