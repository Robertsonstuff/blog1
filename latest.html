	<h1>When does practice make perfect?</h1>
	<br>
	<cite>-Much Love 8:11pm 20/05/2020 -</cite>By me.
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>I know how good it feels when you can learn something new and have something to show for it - I feel the latter part of that sentence is the deceptively hard part. Learning something new is as easy as typing something into Google, but having something to show for it is entirely different. I want to ask you the question every muso asks themselves when they learn something new.  When are you ready to perform what they've been practising for weeks? Sometimes months! It's the time where you can have something to show for all your hard work but you don't want to stuff it up right? This is super tricky, but I'm happy to share some wisdom I've collected over almost two decades on this subject to help my fellow muso. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In my mind, there are three main concepts that you'll need to get comfy with to have something down and performance-ready. This will help anyone who plays an acoustic instrument but understand I'm a drummer so it will make the most sense to us drummers. 
	<br>
	<br>
	#1 dynamics 
	<br>
	It's simple if you're playing an acoustic instrument, I don't even have to explain this, But I will. Dynamics is so important! It's the difference between being a metal groove, rock groove, funk groove, soul groove or jazz groove. Dynamics is everything!! 
	When I talk about dynamics - particularly for drummers - your overall volume is not the whole picture. It's between each limb and note. It does matter if your snare is too loud in comparison to your kick drum. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I know for drummers if you're locked in and grooving hard with your band and you get this great idea to try the new fill you've been practising... So you try it, it fails, the band has stopped grooving and you feel kinda dumb... Been there. It's a common mistake!
	
	Let me share a few ideas on why this happens. If you grip your sticks just that little bit tighter than usual because you want to play with a bit more intensity, you won't have the same feel to access finger techniques or the natural bounce the same way. You maybe be short in drum mics for the night, the Guitarist may have turned up louder than usual and you have to match his volume. 
	If you haven't practised the same lick with different dynamics you will be screwed with any of the above scenarios. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I've heard it explained by my teachers from uni that I think is so true. If you're playing something that you know you can play in the practice room, great! 
	But if you're low on sleep, you're 10% less likely to play it correctly. 
	If you're a little nervous because your mums in the crowd, you're another 10% less likely to play it correctly. 
	If you have crappy sticks and your drum heads aren't tuned up, you're another 10% less likely to play it correctly. 
	If you're low on sound equipment and you can't hear your band properly, you're another 10% less likely to play it correctly. 
	I find this idea a huge help to gain perspective to know how you are feeling before you play. If I'm tired, I'll know that I shouldn't be overly ambitious with my playing that day. 
	<br>
	<br>
	#2 tempo
	<br> 
	Tempo is critical. It goes hand in hand with dynamics I think. Testing yourself with how consistent you are next to your metronome is an endless pursuit. Anyone with "good time" or consistent time can fluctuate between 2 - 10bpm quite easily... Yep, that much! So it stands to reason that you wouldn't play a drum fill at one tempo and one dynamic. Remember this!! because I know it's easy to forget and then you'll get frustrated when you can't play your favourite fills in a live setting. I know this all too well. 
	<br>
	<br>
	#3 ears
	<br> 
	This is the most important point I could make in this whole post. Practice how accurate you can hear your rhythms...
	What does that mean?? 
	Jojo Mayer explains it best in his instructional video. To put it simply, before we can play anything, it helps to hear it. Am I right?? 
	Try these tips, they'll highlight how well you are listening when your playing. 
	Tip #1: play 16th notes with the metronome on crotchets with your right hand leading. After playing this for two bars, take your right hand away and only play the weaker notes - the 'e' and 'a'. The challenge will be playing the weaker notes with your left hand as long as you can evenly. If it sounds uneven. Don't stop, try and correct it as best you can. 
	Tip #2: When you're playing anything on the kit with a metronome - a back-beat, finger exercise, double kick exercise - whatever it is.  Move that metronome to the off beats, or move to just the beat of 2. The idea is to move the metronome around and see if you can still practice along with consistency. 
	If you want to practise these tips effectively and to a higher level. Try it at different tempos and dynamics ;) 
	<br>
	<br>
	The feelings of nailing something new in front of a crowd is electric! Any muso will tell you how good this feels but as you play for a longer time, those feelings occur less and less. I have a theory about this that may help. Two things: The longer you play, the bigger your goal, the longer it takes to achieve said goal. Two: if we zoom out and look at our lifestyle as a whole. Try splitting up your time. If you have a shit time performing music, you may have a good time recording and learning something new or if designing your website isn't turning how you'd planned you may come across a great soloing idea when you're teaching a student a new concept. Gone of the days where musos can be so single functioning (only a studio muso, only a session guy). We have to do it all now. But that's a subject for another time. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Let me know how these tips and concept help you.
